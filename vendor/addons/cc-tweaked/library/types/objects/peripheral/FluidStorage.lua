---Get all "tanks" in this fluid storage
---
---Each tank either contains some amount of fluid or is empty. Tanks with fluids
---inside will return some basic information about the fluid, including its name
---and amount.
---
---The returned table is sparse, and so empty tanks will be nil - it is
---recommended to loop over using pairs rather than ipairs.

---Move a fluid from one container to another connected one
---@param toName string The name of the peripheral/container to
---@param limit? number The maximum amount of fluid to move
---@param fluidName? string The name of the fluid to move. If not given, a random fluid will be moved
---@return number fluidMoved The amount of fluid moved
---@throws If the target container doesn't exist
