---Functions for finding and controlling peripherals (such as a drive, monitor,
---or turtle) attached to this computer
---
---### Referencing Peripherals
---Computers can interact with adjacent peripherals. Each peripheral is given a
---name based on which direction it is in:\
---`"bottom"`, `"top"`, `"left"`, `"right"`, `"front"`, `"back"`
---
---It's also possible to use peripherals which are further away using modems.
---Place one modem against your computer and another modem against your
---peripheral. You can then right click the modem to use (or attach) the
---peripheral. This will print a peripheral name to chat, which can then be used
---just like a direction name to access the peripheral. You can click on the
---message to copy the name to your clipboard.
---
---### Using Peripherals
---Once you have the name of a peripheral, you can call functions on it using
---`peripheral.call()`. Once you start making a couple of peripheral
---calls this can get very repetitive, and so we can wrap a peripheral. This
---builds a table of all the peripheral's functions so you can use it like an API
---or module.
---
---### Finding Peripherals
---Sometimes you just need to know a peripheral exists. Thankfully there's
---`peripheral.find()`. This takes a peripheral type and returns all the attached
---peripherals which are of this type.
---
---What is a peripheral type though? This is a string which describes what a
---peripheral is, and so what functions are available on it. For instance,
---speakers are just called `speaker`, and monitors `monitor`. Some peripherals
---might have more than one type - a Minecraft chest is both a `minecraft:chest`
---and `inventory`. You can get all the types a peripheral has with
---`peripheral.getType()`, and check a peripheral is a specific type with
---`peripheral.hasType()`.
