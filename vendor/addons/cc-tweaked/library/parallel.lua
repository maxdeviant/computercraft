---Offers a simple way to run multiple functions at once
---
---Functions are not actually run simultaneously, however, this API will
---automatically switch between them whenever they yield (whether that be through
---`coroutine.yield()`, or functions that call that, such as `os.pullEvent()`)
---
---Each function executed in "parallel" gets its own copy of the event queue,
---and so "event consuming" functions (again, mostly anything that causes the
---script to pause - e.g. `os.sleep`, `rednet.receive`, most of the turtle API, etc)
---can safely be used in one without affecting the event queue accessed by the
---other.
---
---⚠️ Be careful to pass in the function you want to execute in parallel and not
---the result of that function (don't *call* the function)

parallel = {}

---Switches between the execution of the functions until any one of them finishes
---
---Should one of the functions error, it will be propgated up to this
---`parallel.waitForAny()` call
---@param ... function The functions to be run in "parallel"
---## Example
---```
---local function tick()
---    while true do
---        os.sleep(1)
---        print("Tick")
---    end
---end
---local function wait_for_q()
---    repeat
---        local _, key = os.pullEvent("key")
---    until key == keys.q
---    print("Q was pressed!")
---end
---
-----Print a message every second until the q key is pressed
---parallel.waitForAny(tick, wait_for_q)
---print("Everything done!")
---```

---[Official Documentation](https://tweaked.cc/module/parallel.html#v:waitForAny)
function parallel.waitForAny(...) end

---Switches between the execution of the functions until they all finish
---
---Should one of the functions error, it will be propgated up to this
---`parallel.waitForAll()` call
---@param ... function
---## Example
---```
---local function a()
---    os.sleep(1)
---    print("A is done")
---end
---local function b()
---    os.sleep(3)
---    print("B is done")
---end
---
-----Start two timers and wait for both to finish
---parallel.waitForAll(a, b)
---print("Everything done!")
---```

function parallel.waitForAll(...) end
