---Turtles are a robot that can break/place blocks, attack mobs, and move around
---the world. They have an inventory of 16 slots, allowing them to store blocks
---they have broken or would like to place.
---
---### Moving a turtle
---Turtles are blocks and can therefor move around the world on Minecraft's
---grid, one block at a time. Moving a turtle (but not turning it) consumes fuel.
---If a turtle does not have fuel, it will refuse to move and the movement
---functions will return `false`. To prevent a runaway turtle, it is recommended
---to wrap your movement functions with `assert()` to throw a fatal error, if
---you don't want to handle errors in a different way, like so:
---
---```
---assert(turtle.forward())
---```
---
---### Upgrades
---A base turtle can move around and place blocks, however, through upgrades,
---they can do even more such as mine, dig, till, attack, and more. Turtles have
---a slot on their left and right sides where you can equip tools (sword,
---pickaxe, hoe, etc.) or peripherals (modem, speaker)
